Hopefully one day it will benefit someone who is learning Unity.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nFor now, the player can pick up different weapons (pistol, smg, shotgun, machine gun) which use ammunition available in limited quantity.\r\nThe enemies walk straight towards the player and attack him/her when he/she is in range.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
